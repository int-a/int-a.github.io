I'm a software engineer in Hartford, CT. I've worked on large-scale databases and analytical systems, as well as rule processing engines meant to externalize business logic from front-end apps for scalability. In my spare time I'm working on Android apps.

I'm interested in all kinds of tech as well as the constantly changing ways that we interact with it. Mobile platforms are my passion, I've watched the Android ecosystem grow and improve ever since I got my first smartphone. I want to be a part of that and make the platform better through my own work.

I'm also an avid traveler, and a guitar player. Music is another passion of mine and I'm always looking for new bands to listen to and songs to learn on the guitar. As for travel, ever since studying abroad in Lisbon, Portugal I've wanted to explore new cultures and experience natural wonders all around the world. I've checked a few off my list, but there are still so many more to go.
